            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Most of my job experience comes from customer service, hard work, and problem solving. Previous jobs have
                given me the opportunity to work with a variety of people in very different circumstances. This has
                given me great people skills and I have learned to work effectively. I also have performed many
                difficult tasks that have taught me how to work hard and to not stop until the job is done. As an
                employee that has carried many positions throughout companies, I do well to adapt to different jobs
                and situations to make things work smoothly, efficiently, as well as enjoyable for me and the rest
                of my team.
